== Notes on Crealty Ender 3 V2

Generally it has worked well with the Ender 3 (not v2) settings in Cura.
Recently had a melt-down where a 12hr print failed in the middle.  It kept running making spaghetti overnight.

The nozzle and rest of the hot end were completely clogged with some brown burnt stuff.  Ended up replacing the nozzle and Bowden tube, and cleaning the hot end with a bit of teflon tube per the Crealty video.

After that treatment I had trouble with adhesion.  I replaced the blue tape, and made the following suggested cura setting changes:

To get a sticky first layer, you can change some settings in your slicer. (Cura as an example)

1. change initial layer height to 0.35.

2. increase the initial layer line width to 120%(experimental).

3. slow the first layer print speed to 10mm/s or less.

Trying again now.
